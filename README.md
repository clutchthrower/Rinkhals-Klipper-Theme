## Installation

Installing this custom theme is straightforward. Since there's no installer, you'll manually replace the existing `.theme` folder with the one provided here. Here's how:

1. **Backup Your Current Theme**: Before proceeding, it's crucial to back up your current theme. Navigate to the location of your Klipper's `.theme` folder and copy it to a safe location.

3. **Download**: Download the '.theme` folder.

4. **Replace the Theme Folder**: Follow instructions on the Klipper site to show .theme folder from within the web interface or replace files locally on the host machine @ /home/ 'youruser' /printer_data/config/.theme

5. **Refresh Broswer... Maybe**: On the host Linux box I need to refresh the page, on Windows I don't, both are using Microsoft Edge Browser
